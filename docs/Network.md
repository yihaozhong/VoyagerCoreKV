# Common Topics in Computer Networks (Beginner Edition)

## Chapters

### Overview of Computers

- What is the difference between P2P and CS networks?
- What are speed, bandwidth, and latency?
- What are packet loss rate and throughput?
- Why do computer networks need to be layered?
- What are the seven layers of the OSI model?
- What does each layer of the OSI model do? (A more in-depth understanding comes with overall learning)
- What are the five layers of the TCP/IP model?

### Network Applications

- What network protocols are in the application layer?
- What is DNS? What is its function? How does DNS resolution work?
- How to address processes in the network?
- HTTP
  - What is the HTTP protocol? How does it work? What are the common HTTP request methods?
  - What are the common HTTP methods?
  - What is the difference between GET and POST methods?
  - What are HTTP status codes?
  - What is the structure of HTTP requests and responses?
  - What are HTTP cookies?
  - What is the role of HTTP caching?
- Socket Programming
  - How to create a socket connection? How to establish communication between server and client?
  - What are the common errors in socket programming? How to handle them?
  - How to implement heartbeat detection and timeout handling in socket programming?
  - How to achieve load balancing and failover in socket programming?

### Transport Layer

- TCP
  - What are the differences between TCP and UDP? What are their application scenarios?
  - What are the TCP three-way handshake and four-way termination? Why are these handshakes and terminations needed?
  - How does TCP congestion control work? What are its algorithms?
  - What are TCP sticky packets and split packets? How to avoid them?
  - How to achieve reliable data transmission using TCP? For example, if a packet is lost, how does TCP ensure it is retransmitted and reaches its destination?
  - How is TCP flow control implemented? What is the sliding window protocol? How to calculate window size?
  - What is the TCP time-wait state? Why is this state needed?
  - How does TCP support multiplexing? What are the advantages of TCP multiplexing?
  - What is the TCP header structure? What fields does it contain?
- UDP
  - What are the advantages and disadvantages of UDP? Why is UDP used instead of TCP in some cases?
  - What reliability mechanisms does UDP have? For example, if a packet is lost, how does UDP ensure it is retransmitted and reaches its destination?
  - What is the UDP header structure? What fields does it contain?

### Network Layer

- What is an IP address? What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
- What is a subnet mask? What is its function?
- What is the structure of an IP packet? What is the meaning of each field?
- How does an IP packet travel from the source host to the destination host?
- What is routing? What is a routing table?
- What is NAT? What is its function?
- What is ARP protocol in the IP protocol suite? What is its function?
- What is ICMP protocol in the IP protocol suite? What is its function?
- What is broadcasting in the IP protocol suite? What is its function?
- What is DHCP protocol in the IP protocol suite? What is its function?
- What is IP address classification in the IP protocol suite? What are the classification standards?
